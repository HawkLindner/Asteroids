# Purpose
I am creating this project because I love to code, and what better way to code than to do it with something else that I love. Truthfully I 
love these old arcade games, and I also am building it because I dont have much to do at my girlfriends dorm while she is doing homework, but
I am doing this to challange myself and to push myself to keep beating the odds. When I started this project I knew very little about C++. I 
had just finished my N-Body simulation that represents planatery motion using OpenGL and OpenMp with a group of buddies from school. So I wanted
to challange myself to prove to myself that I can do this and when it comes to working for a large corperation, I can buckle down and get it done. I enjoy the challange becuase it pushes me to think. And with the help of AI, I am able to get some of the hard to find bugs out of the way and get good ideas on approach stratagies, but this code is still my work. Some of it from AI, but all is reviewed, revised and updated to fit my programs demands.
